![About me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikijiandani/nikijiandani.github.io/master/assets/niki---about-me-M.png)

I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about making web content responsive, accessible and pixel perfect. I always like a new challenge and get excited and curious about solving problems with technology.

When I'm not writing code, I like to run, ride my bicycle, swim, paddleboard, fly airplanes, travel and paint. I also like to hike and go on long walks.

I currently work as a Developer at Shopify.
