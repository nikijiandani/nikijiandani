![About me](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nikijiandani/nikijiandani.github.io/master/assets/niki---about-me-M.png)

I am a Full Stack Developer passionate about making web content responsive, accessible and pixel perfect. I always like a new challenge and get excited and curious about solving problems with technology. After teaching myself how to code for about a year, I decided to pursue a bootcamp to kickstart my web development career. I graduated from the Lighthouse Labs Web Development bootcamp and I currently work as a Software Developer at Caseware.

When I'm not writing code, I like to fly airplanes, travel, bake, paint and ride my bicycle. I also like to hike and go on long walks.
